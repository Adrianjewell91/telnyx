//now how to get the in the right order. I don't know how. I could relegate that to a database?s
//for now just get them rendering and have an add comment at the end (with parent ID of null)s

//strategy one: iterate through objects, check parent_id
//Thank you to nu11ptr on Stack Overflow for this method, comments are my own.
//Basically a topographical sort function.
